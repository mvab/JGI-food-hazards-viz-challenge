- Use Kepler to show which events happened where, with lines/arcs from country of origin to notifying country
    - Temporal aspect- iterate through weeks/months and filter based on that
    - Focus on just 'recall' events for now
    - Start by working with just 'allergen' events
        - But could include others as project progresses
    - why bother including notifying country? we could just do hexes for country of origin with colour representing frequency

- Host on github.io page, have different tabs with different configurations
    - html or json?
- Is there a way to lock the config?
    - Instead could just have reset button which reloads config from file
