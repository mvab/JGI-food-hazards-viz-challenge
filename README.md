This repo contains the work done for Jean Golding Institute Food hazards [data visualisation challenge][1]

The entry for the challenge is available here: https://mvab.github.io/JGI-food-hazards-viz-challenge/

:tada: We won the runner-up prize in the challenge: [JGI blogpost announcing winners](https://jeangoldinginstitute.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2020/09/16/food-hazards-from-around-the-world-data-competition/)

:nerd_face: We wrote a [blogpost](https://ieureka.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2020/10/06/visualising-brexits-impact-on-food-safety-in-britain/) for IUEREKA about our data visualisation.
